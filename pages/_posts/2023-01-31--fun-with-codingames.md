I have had a go at a lot of different programming sites, all aiming to let you
exercise your skills as a developer and have fun at the same time.

In my opinion, [codingame.com](https://www.codingame.com) stands out due to
sheer effort they put into it. There is an impressive variety of challenges
 across both puzzle type and challenge level and they have a lot of neat themes,
and graphical representations. There's even an ever helpful forum for each
puzzle if you're stuck or confused.

If you feel like exercising a bit before diving into the work of the day, there
are 5 minute live competitions called 'Code Clash', and there are single player
puzzles that may take a decent programmer a long time to figure out. If you're
more competitively inclined there are a different multiple player games too.

There's also support many different programming languages including `Golang`,
`Javascript`, `Typescript`, `C#`, `F#`, `Java`, `Bash`, `Python` and `Kotlin`.
It quite impressive. 

If you register a profile, you can get a meta-gamification like personal levels,
achievements, titles, and a 'quest map' which can be used both for your own
intrinsic motivation and for your resume - since the site is also a opt-in,
non-obtrusive recruiter platform.

I, for example, have learned much on functional programming, good and bad code
structure and nifty language constructs, and had a lot of fun at the same time
=D!

test cases, you're gifted with a live rendering of Thor trying to hit giants

## Shadows of the Knight - episode 2

This month I finally solved the expert level puzzle ['Shadows of the Knight'
episode
2](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-2).
Perhaps the puzzle I've struggled the most with. I tried it for the first time 4
years ago, were I got stuck on a somewhat still satisfying 75% completion of the
hidden test cases. 

Now, after a successful return, I get to see how other's have solved the puzzle,
since published solutions are first available after the 100% completion. I tend
put a lot of effort into cleaning up by own code and publishing it for
comparison - which I personally find is a worthwhile learning experience.

## Next Up

I now look forward to trying out [Coding
Escape](https://escape.codingame.com/games), a type of puzzle I haven't tried
yet, to get the last 6 medium puzzle achievements and maybe get another progress
marker checked on the quest map.

I will happily recommend this site for any enthusiastic coder out there. In my
personal opinion, this is a must try. 

Happy hacking! ^_^
