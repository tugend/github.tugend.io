I have had a go at a lot of different programming sites, all aiming to make it
fun to exercise your skills as a developer and have fun at the same time.

In my opinion, [codingame.com](https://www.codingame.com) stands out due to
sheer effort the put into it. There is an impressive variety of challenges with
respect to both puzzle type and challenge level and they put a lot of effort
into fun themes, and graphical representations. There's even an ever helpful
forum for each puzzle if you're stuck or confused.

*The 'Power of Thor episode 2' puzzle. To show how your solution handles the
test cases, you're gifted with a live rendering of Thor trying to hit giants
with thunderbolts!*

There are 5 minute 'code clashes' (5 minute live competitions) if you feel like
exercising a bit before diving into the work of the day and there are offline
single player puzzles, where if you solve all known and hidden test cases, you
get to learn by reading other players solutions. If you're more competitive
inclined there's a lot of different multiple player games too. Amazing!

All of this and more, with a huge range of supported programming languages. It
is frankly amazing and fantastic. To top it all off, it's also strongly gamified
including levels, achievements, titles, and a 'quest map' aka progression board.

I have learned so much about functional programming, good and bad code structure
and nifty language constructs, and had a lot of fun at the same time! 

This month I finally solved the export level puzzle
'shadows-of-the-knight-episode-2'. I tried the puzzle for the first time 4 year
ago where I got stuck after the first achievement on a 75% completion of the
hidden test cases. After solving the last case I enjoyed cleaning up my own
solution and then compared mine to the other published solutions - and of course
I also published my own! =)

I now look forward to trying out [Coding
Escape](https://escape.codingame.com/games), a type of puzzle I haven't tried
yet, to get the last 6 medium puzzle achievements and maybe get another progress
marker checked on the quest map.

I will happily recommend this site for any enthusiastic coder out there. In my personal opinion, this is a must try. 

Happy hacking! ^_^
