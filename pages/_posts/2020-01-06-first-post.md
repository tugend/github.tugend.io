First post! Jay. I've set this up using **[Github Pages][githubpages]** and
built the site using the ruby tool **[Jekyll][jekyll]** with some awesome theme
called **[Julia][julia]**.

I'm a bit annoyed, having to compile using the hated Ruby instead of something
sensible like Node, but eh.

Right now it looks worth it though, the theme looks really nice and the
structure is exactly what I hoped for. There was little fuzz after set up and it
looks to be easily custimizable and clean. The hosting is practical and
relevantly via github pages and I get to keep the source markdown files in the
same repo.

**Huzza!**

Going forward, I've set all personal repositories to private, and will try try
to be a bit strict in maintaining only clean and well-documented public projects
for public prousal. Doing so should also help making it easier to present a pro
portfolio and go back to older projects and understand what the heck I made
later.

The purpose of this blog should be to document my projects and whatever deep and
profound stuff I learn and feel like sharing (probably rants mostly).
