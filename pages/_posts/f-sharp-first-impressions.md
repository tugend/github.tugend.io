### F\# ~ Impressions
 
I've written F\# a little on and off both at work and in private.
I guess I spend somewhere between 40'ish hours working in the language.

Sadly, this is the first time, I met such a steep learning curve, than
I never even got comfortable in the basics of the language. I really tried to 
take to the language but it never quite felt right to work with.

Here's my main impressions of the language.

* Learning resources: 13 turtles, Microsoft, Koans. 
The learning resources are okay'ish, but compared to many of the other languages out there,
they just doesn't feel fun or community driven.

* The language keeps feeling awkward to type, especially the much used '<-', '|>' operators
just doesn't fit well with my keystrokes and I'll never enjoy the constant need to type '(fun ...)'
every time I have to define a lambda. Why can't I just type '_ -> ...' like in all other languages (JS, C\#), the same goes for the array '[|"extra characters"; "are fantastic"|'?

* Sure the languages is supposed to have some nifty features, but at the end of the day,
it feels like back in the day where your friend kept telling you about how amazing EMACs.
It feels complicated and difficult to write, and you can be certain non of your colleagues 
will like to contribute to that part of the code base.

* The support, and IDE haven't really blown me away either.

* At the end of the day, I'd always prefer to write C\# in a functional and strict way instead.
  Better support, stronger community, more productive, more fun, easier to find collaborators.
  better tooling, never met any serious limitations irt. performance, and you can still read and 
  run your own code after half a year.

  And yes, you can make mutable stuff easy in C\# but sadly I see the same in F\#, the mutable keyword
  is just added everywhere, and in Typescript 'Any' grows like a fungus. Sometimes it's more a matter of 
  keep to conventions, and not so much picking a language where it's non-default anything. (also, records, pattern matching, ..)

(check, and find examples of the claims above)
