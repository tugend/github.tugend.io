First blog post! Jay. I'm a bit annoyed, having to compile using the hated
Ruby instead of something sensible like Node, but eh.

Right now it looks worth it though, the Julia Theme looks really nice and the
structure is exactly what I hoped for. There was little fuzz after set up and
it looks to be easily custimizable and clean. The hosting is practical and
relevantly via github pages and I get to keep the source markdown files in the
same repo..

Huzza!

Going forward, I'll set all repos to private moving forward, and be a bit strict
in documented and cleaning up projects for prousal, and to make sure I can figure
out what the heck I made later on.

The purpose of this blog should be to document my projects and whatever deep and
profound stuff I learn and feel like sharing (probably rants mostly).
