What could be fun projects for digging into some ml?
These are some of the ideas I could come up with.

## Ideas

* Use predictive writing to generate a chapter of some book like LOTR or HP
* Write an app that can read cursive hand-writing.
* Write a self learning bot that can play some simple game
* Write a program that can categorize whether a tweet from Trump is angry or happy
