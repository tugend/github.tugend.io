First blog post! Jay. I'm a bit annoying having to compile using the hated
rubylang instead of something sensible like node, but eh.

Right now it looks worth it though, the Julia tTheme looks really nice and the
structure is exactly what I hoped for. There was super little fuzz after set up and
it looks to be easily custimizable and clean. The hosting is practical and
relevantly via github pages and I get to keep the source markdown files in the
same repo..

Huzza!
