# Creating a creative pocket dimension in time and space

> Hence forth I will try to write my blogposts in english. For what ever reason, it seems the most appropriate.

What do I mean by such an audacious title? Those of us not fortunate enough to have plenty of rooms and oppurtunity, have to use for an example our living room for something else than creative business too, hence the time and space part.

I am often inspired to do, wo work, to challenge my self, and to accomplish, but the sad reality is that most of the time I end up mired in day-to-day rutines, minor everyday jobs and the tedious need to keep track of every thing. To avoid that I will try to apply the following set of techniques, techniques I hope will help me repeatedly create a pocket dimension in time and space.

## Techniques for creating pocket dimensions

### Lo-fi music

Music or sounds can be a gateway to elsewhere inside the mind. Be wary though, it can take you to many places. I find that the somewhat unrecognized genre of low-fidelity music works wonders for me. I would describe it as a kind of structured white-noise. It helps distracting the 'monkey brain' from ruining your focus.

One of my favorite numbers is 'RAINING IN ＯＳＡＫＡ (Lofi HipHop)' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOJsKatW-Ts.

### An inspiring and clutter free environment

A barrier I often hit, when I want to create my pocket dimension, there a cluttered work desk brimming with all the reminders of other stuff I really need to do. My computer is just of to the side promising fun and distractions, just a click away from Facebook, Youtube, Imgur, Emails or the newest Steam download.

To avoid this, I have bough an old an cheap laptop, it's easy to bring with me and move at will. It's setup to deny most of my casual online proscrastinations, it does not have any games installed and most importantly, I try to train myself to see it as a sort-of typewriter, a tool not meant for entertainment but for purpose!

Finally, take care to pick a spot free of discractions, be it the cleared living room table, a random cafe, on a bench in the garden or the local park. Make sure to bring only the bare neccessities.

### Take your time

A pocket dimesion can exist for just one hour or much longer, the important part is that you stay in it until you live. It will not work if you switch, everything will break and your creative energy will leak as water from a broken boat.

I have most experience with pocket dimensions in evenings or nights, and cafés. Rainy days are some of the best. Hence forth I will try to create a stronger momentum, by creating a big dimension every Saturday.

### Prioritize

Typically, I have a long list or even lists of what I want spend time on, sketching, writing, coding, gardening, planning, arranging, you name it. Each subject can have many subcategories too. The switching is what will break you, to however random you do it, pick something and do not consider the alternatives. If you switch, do not go back. Let your focus flow ever forward until you leave the dimension.

It is okay to bring the prerequisites for working on a small number of different focai or projects, often it's beneficial to just pick one, but if you feel enough progress has been made (not if you get stuck!) it's often nice to have something else to take on.

The important bit is to limit the noice and your choices, make everything simple and easy to begin, let the real challenge be in your mind instead.

### Flow

If you really hit it off, you'll get into a flow. Time ceases to exist and you just release everything you have into your focus. It's a wonderful experience. Take heed to stop before you burn out, some of the best projects occur when you leave a cliffhanger and a feeling that you just can't wait to get back to 'work'.
